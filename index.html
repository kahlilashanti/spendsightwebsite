                  Coming to terms with a violently abusive childhood led Kahlil to 'escape' to the US Air Force, which is what brought him to Nellis AFB, Las Vegas in 1992 and gave him his first sense of family and belonging.  After selling his first entrepreneurial idea to Caesars Palace and performing magic in Japanese at Caesars Magical Empire from 1997-2000, Kahlil embarked upon a journey that's seen him twice selected for Cirque Du Soleil and perform his own story on Broadway.  This led to a lengthy consulting career working with casino talent buyers around the world, who expressed their desire to understand the retail habits of their players but lamented at the lack of user friendly affordable solutions on the market.  After many years of working and talking with casino operators and intensive research, Kahlil tested a solution and built it himself.
